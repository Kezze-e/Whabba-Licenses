# Whabba
Whabba licenses are simple, easy, and have short as well as detailed versions.
* Note: I have used [Ginger](https://www.gingersoftware.com/) in order to correct the grammar of licenses. 


## About
Whabba is a simple & easy to understand license system.

Start & what I call "sub-licenses"

Every license will start with:
``` 
 WH*Licenses Sub-license-Sub-License
 Sub-License-Sub-License
 Copyright <year> <copyright holder>
```

### What are "sub-licenses"
Sub licenses are like Creative Commons NC or Non-Commercial, Which in this case I modified so they're not 1:1 Creative Commons-like.

Currently, the available sub-licenses are:  
`Non-C or Non-Commercial` - Your work may not be used for money.  
`Non-E or Non-Editable` - Your work may not be edited.  
`Non-A or No Attribution needed` - Crediting you is an option.  
`SRL or Same Release License` - Edited work must be released under the same license as your work.  
`AR or Attribution Required` - Attribution must be given to you.  
`E-W or Editable Work` - Your work may be freely edited.  
`nAi or No-Ai` - Your work may not be used in order to train Artificial intelligence.
